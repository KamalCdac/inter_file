Traits: 

With the Help of traits we can use multiple Inheritance in PHP. Because PHP is Support Single Inheitance.
Traits are used to declare methods that can be used in multiple classes.

example : 
<?php
trait message1 {
public function msg1() {
    echo "OOP is fun! ";
  }
}

class Welcome {
  use message1;
}

$obj = new Welcome();
$obj->msg1();
?>

Abstract Classes:
An abstract class is a class that contains at least one abstract method. An abstract method is a method that is declared, but not implemented. Every abstract methods defined in the abstract class must be implemented inside the extended class.

Abstraction:
The Representation of data in which hide all implementation details are hidden.

Polymorphism:-

Polymorphism is one of the PHP Object Oriented Programming (OOP) features.
 There are two types of Polymorphism; they are: 
Compile time (function overloading)
Run time (function overriding)

function overloading:--
Function overloading is a feature that permits making several methods with a similar name that works differently.

function overriding:-
In function overriding, the parent and child classes have the same function name with and number of arguments

Access modifier:

public - the property or method can be accessed from everywhere. This is default.
protected - the property or method can be accessed within the class and by classes derived from that class.
private - the property or method can ONLY be accessed within the class.

To get the nth higest salary 
SELECT emp_name AS Employee, salary AS Salary FROM employee ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT N-1,1;

3rd higest salary
SELECT emp_name AS Employee, salary AS Salary FROM employee ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 2,1;

The templating engine used in Laravel is Blade. 


How to put Laravel applications in maintenance mode?

php artisan down

php artisan up


11. What are seeders in Laravel?

Different relationships available in Laravel are:

One to One
One to Many
Many to Many
Has One Through
Has Many Through
One to One (Polymorphic)
One to Many (Polymorphic)
Many to Many (Polymorphic)

middleware:

middleware which checks if the user is authenticated and if the user is authenticated it will go further in the application otherwise it will throw the user back to the login screen.


Eloquent:
eloquent model that allows the interaction with a database. Each database table has its corresponding model that provides the interaction with a database. 

select command:
$categories = CategoryModel::select('catID', 'catName', 'imgPath')
                           ->where('catType', '=', 'Root')
                           ->get();

ANS: 1. Interfaces cannot have properties, 
     2.while abstract classes can. 
     3.All interface methods must be public, 
     4. while abstract class methods is public or protected
2. overloading and overridding

Diffrence Between PHP 5 and Above
1) zend engine PHP 5 , PHP 7 next Gen ,  PHP 8 Next gen
2) PHP 5 anonumus class not use , and 7 above we use anonumus class //Its use to direct implement the class (in which no name in class)
3) PHP 7 above verion have new inbulit 1) operators spaceship operator , 2) Null coalescing  opreator
1.Spaceship Operator
>> it is used for  comparission print( 1 <=> 1);
2.Null coalescing  opreator
   can say to remove the if else many time
>> $username = $_GET['username'] ?? 'not passed';
